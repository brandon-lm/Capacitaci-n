      <h2>History</h2>
      <p>Itachi was born into the Uchiha clan, being the eldest son of the clan leader, Fugaku Uchiha and his wife Mikoto Uchiha. He was always 
        considered and praised as the best in his generation, a genius above all others. He even surpassed the expectations of a skilled member of 
        the Uchiha Clan. However, not even his family, friends or teachers could understand him. When he was only four years old, Itachi had already
        witnessed the loss of many lives due to the Third Shinobi World War, which emotionally traumatized him, to the point of considering suicide,
        and made him become a pacifist. At the age of 7, he graduated from the Ninja Academy at the top of his class after only one year, around 
        that time he began to take an interest in the origin of the village, mastered the Sharingan at the age of eight, passed the Chūnin exams at 
        the age of 10, and became a captain of the ANBU units at 13 years old.</p>

        </div>
      <p>He was highly praised by his father, who saw the future of the family in Itachi, so he neglected his youngest son, Sasuke Uchiha. 
        However, during this time Itachi showed great affection towards his younger brother, and even encouraged his father to come to Sasuke's 
        Enrollment ceremony to the Academy, something his father had forgotten saying he had an important mission to establish Itachi to the ANBU ranks.</p>
      <p>When the Uchiha Clan began planning to overthrow Konoha, Itachi, as ANBU, was tasked with spying on the village. Knowing that a coup 
        would only lead to a new ninja war, Itachi began spying on the Uchiha instead, relaying information to the Third Hokage and the other 
        elders of Konoha. During this time he began to act strangely, as he would not attend clan meetings, speaking out against the clan and was 
        also considered the prime suspect for the murder of his best friend, Shisui Uchiha, who had drowned in the Nakano River. Because of this, 
        the clan had given up hope on Itachi, and his father began to shift his focus to Sasuke instead. Meanwhile, the Third Hokage's attempts to 
        negotiate a peaceful end to the hostilities between the two sides are proving ineffective; thus, against the Third's wishes, Danzo Shimura 
        and the Konoha Council ordered Itachi to exterminate the entire Uchiha Clan. Itachi agreed on the sole condition that his brother not be 
        harmed, justifying that it must be an Uchiha to execute him in the future for the genocide of the Clan.</p>

      <h2>Abilities</h2>
      <p>Itachi Uchiha has demonstrated extraordinary qualities from an early age, such as his intellect and exceptional talent for all ninja disciplines. He managed to graduate from the ninja academy at the young age of 7, become a Chūnin at the age of 10 and captain of an ANBU squad at the age of 13; he was also admired by teachers who assured that his progress did not need any help, it is difficult to name all his achievements, but it cannot be said that it measures Itachi's true ability, his true potential can only be understood by those who come close to his level.</p>
        <div class="img2">

        </div>
      <p>Being a pacifist, due to his traumatic experiences, Itachi does not actively participate in battle, usually only acting in self-defense and trying to defeat his enemies rather than kill them if possible. It could also be said that in each of his battles, Itachi's full strength is kept hidden, either due to his non-violent nature or his terminal illness. However, the times he has been seen fighting he has shown remarkable skills,</p>

      <p>The skills that Itachi handles are: </p>
      <ol>
       <b><li>Taijutsu</li></b>
          <ul>Although his most common attacks were based on Genjutsu, Itachi was also highly skilled in Taijutsu, this ability was at a high level even though he was not a specialist in it. He proved this when he easily defeated Tekka, Yashiro and Inabi, all of them his superiors and members of the Konoha Military Police. In the first part, during the meeting in the Land of Fire, he was able to stop the Chidori of his brother, Sasuke, with one hand, thus avoiding the attack, then taking him by the wrist breaking his arm and kicked him to the other side of the room to hit him again.</ul><br>

          <ul>His speed was also very remarkable. In the first part, the speed to perform his hand seals was so fast, that he could perform ninjutsu in record time. In terms of the agility of his movements, he was able to kick Kurenai Yuhi with surprising speed, during their brief battle in Konoha. In terms of movement, he was able to move considerable distances with great speed. Likewise, he was enormously fast at throwing Shuriken and Kunai.</ul><br>

       <b> <li>Ninjutsu</li></b>
          <ul>In Itachi's techniques the presence of crows was common, both in ninjutsu and genjutsu, for example, he was able to create a clone that was divided into a large number of crows and these attacked the opponent with several shuriken, he could also summon crows to use them as a distraction. Itachi is also a common user of the Jutsu: Shadow Clone and the Jutsu: Crow Clone. For example during his battle against Sasuke, at the moment when they were performing a continuous shuriken attack, Itachi was able to create a shadow clone and attack his brother with it.</ul><br>

          <ul>Itachi was a great user of the Fire Element, he knew jutsus like the flames of the phoenix or the great ball of fire jutsu, characteristic of his clan. He also showed to be a user of the Water Element by which he could use jutsu such as the water dragon missile jutsu without needing to have pre-existing water nearby. As a fully trained ANBU of Konoha, Itachi was also skilled in Kenjutsu demonstrated mainly in his battle with Kabuto Yakushi after being reincarnated. Itachi also had great skill with Fūinjutsu, as seen when he performs Transcription Seal: Amaterasu on Sasuke, just moments before his death.</ul><br>

        <b><li>Bukijutsu</li></b>
        <ul>
              <li>Shurikenjutsu</li>
                <ul>Itachi was also very fast with hand movements. He was able to attack with several shuriken using only one hand and at the same time attack the opponent with a ninjutsu. His talent with shuriken is such that he was able to hit eight hidden spots in the forest and hit correctly from the air, despite even being behind the backs of some of the targets; also hitting the blind spot of the shared vision of Nagato, the Giant Snake-tailed Chameleon and the King of Hell, hitting the eyes of the latter two, thus leaving the wielder of the Rinnegan vulnerable. His skill was such that he could hit two Naruto clones suspended in mid-motion backwards with the greatest of ease.</ul>
            </ul><br>

        <b><li>Kenjutsu</li></b>
          <ul>As an ANBU of Konohagakure, Itachi made good use of the sword, being skilled in killing with it. He showed his swordsmanship in his missions as an ANBU as well as in the Uchiha Clan Massacre, killing several of his clan members in this way, such as his parents.</ul><br>

        <b><li>Dōjutsu</li></b>
            <ul>
              <li>Sharingan</li>
                <ul>As Itachi was born into the Uchiha Clan he was able to develop the Kekkei Genkai of his clan, the Sharingan, but unlike the other members, Itachi was able to awaken it at the early age of 8, being considered one of the most skilled of his clan. Like all bearers of this Dojutsu, Itachi could use his abilities but to a high degree, being able to attack three Sharingan-bearing ninjas in a second.</ul><br>
                <ul>But this shinobi was mainly characterized by his ability to study his opponent's movements at a long distance and respond quickly, almost always using Genjutsu. Like all Sharingan bearers, he was able to induce his enemies with simple eye contact. He had also trained his eyes so much that he was able to have the Sharingan activated for a long period of time, with minimal chakra drain.</ul>
            </ul><br>

        <b><li>Mangekyo Sharingan</li></b>
            <ul>
              Itachi possessed the Mangekyō Sharingan, which increased his power exponentially easily surpassing any normal Sharingan, allowing him to use the eye techniques derived from it. With his left eye he could use Tsukuyomi, a Genjutsu that trapped his opponent's mind in an illusory world, being able to control space, time and even the mass of objects, with this technique Itachi could attack his victim's nervous system and cause real physical damage even if it was only an illusion. With his right eye he could use Amaterasu, a ninjutsu exclusive to the Mangekyō Sharingan that created black flames that he could direct with his gaze. These flames were fireproof, that is, they did not extinguish and could consume everything including the fire itself. In the words of Black Zetsu, if his left eye possessed the most powerful Genjutsu, his right eye possessed the strongest physical attack, referring to the Tsukuyomi and Amaterasu respectively.
            </ul>
      </ol>

    <div id="tab3">
      <h2>Family</h2>
        <p><li><b>Fugaku Uchiha</b></li></p>
        <p><ol>Itachi was the first-born son of Fugaku Uchiha, head of the Uchiha Clan. Itachi was considered a genius from an early age; he awakened the Sharingan at the age of 8, graduated at the top of his class and was named captain of the ANBU units at 13. For all this, Itachi became Fugaku's favorite son and the center of attention of all Konoha.</ol></p>

        <p><li><b>Mikoto Uchiha</b></li></p>
        <p><ol>Mikoto Uchiha was the mother of Sasuke Uchiha and Itachi Uchiha, and wife of Fugaku Uchiha. She is one of the few people who knows how to recognize Sasuke, although she assures that her husband always talks about her youngest son when he is with her and it is known that she knew Kushina Uzumaki with whom she met the day of Naruto's birth and even introduced her to her newborn son Sasuke whom Kushina mistook for a girl, after Kurama's attack and during a visit to the Konoha hospital she sadly observed little Naruto and deduced that Kushina had died in the attack and had left her newborn son orphaned. During the clan massacre she is seen next to her husband sitting and prepared to be killed by Itachi and told not to be afraid of what he was going to do and that she is aware of the decision she made, just before she dies she tells him that she will always love him no matter what he does, she also asks him as a last wish to take care of her brother Sasuke and then she is killed by Itachi's katana.</ol></p>

        <p><li><b>Sasuke Uchiha</b></li></p>
        <p><ol>Itachi maintained a very close relationship with his younger brother Sasuke, who saw him as a role model and was somewhat envious of him. However, as Itachi got deeper into the ANBU and the Uchiha Clan, he became more and more at odds with the Konoha Council of Elders, their relations became colder. Itachi showed great affection towards his younger brother, and even encouraged his father to come to Sasuke's Enrollment ceremony to the Academy, something his father had forgotten saying that he had an important mission to establish Itachi to the ANBU ranks.</ol></p>

      <h2>Personality</h2>
      <p>Since his first appearance, Itachi had always been a mysterious person and had the intention of hiding his true self. While in his past he proved to be a compassionate brother and a great person, at a certain point in history he had to commit some crimes, even murdering his loved ones and his clan, leaving only one survivor: his younger brother, Sasuke Uchiha. Despite all the shock of his actions, incredibly, he turned out to be that compassionate brother of great courage, making it clear throughout the story that his stay in Akatsuki was also intended to protect his little brother, Sasuke and his village.</p>

      </div>

      <p>In addition to being an incredibly powerful ninja, Itachi had an equally impressive intelligence, and has proven to be very wise, even Tobi recognized it. He was very strong and attentive to any situation that happened, as he was rarely surprised. He also showed great intuition, as he was almost never fooled and yet almost instantly realized the truth. This intelligence can also be seen through Itachi's immense foresight, as examples, such as foreknowledge of Sasuke's defeat of Deidara and also that his brother survived, his own premeditated fatalistic view of death by Sasuke's hand, and more recently the implantation of his own Kotoamatsukami into the crow within Naruto were just a few examples seen of things that surprised him. Despite his status as a wanted criminal, and ending his clan, Itachi does not enjoy violence or combat, preferring to avoid battle or, if that is not possible, to end it as soon as he can.</p><br>
